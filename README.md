# hello-world
Just another repository
Hi Humans!

My name is Tribor, I like Python because that is what I am studying.
I want to get my foot in the foor to coding.
So I thought this would be the best way for me to do it.
My uncle recommended me to get on GitHub and try it out.
He said that this is the only way I can be able to share with him what I have been doing.
